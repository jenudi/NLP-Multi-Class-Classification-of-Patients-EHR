# Intro

This project was conducted as part of the course Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems taught by Dr. Liron Izhaki-Allerhand and taken at Tel-Aviv University, Faculty of Engineering. The main aim of this project was to test well known Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and techniques for the possibility of extracting the "Main Problem" or "Main Symptom" from an unlabeled medical dataset.

The project consists of two parts: the first one an academical research part, and the second is server side development.
