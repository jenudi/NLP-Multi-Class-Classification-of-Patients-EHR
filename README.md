# NLP-Project

# Intro

This project was conducted as part of the course Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems taught by Dr. Liran and taken in Tel-Aviv University, Faculty of Engineering. The main aim of this project was to test well known Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and techniques for the possibility of extracting the "Main Problem" or "Main Symptom" from an unlabeled medical dataset.
The project had two parts, the first one is exploratory, and the second was to build an API and non-structural SQL database.
In this note, we will describe in detail the exploratory part.
